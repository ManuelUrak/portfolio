# Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a personal portfolio website built using **WordPress**, showcasing a collection of personal projects. The site is created with a custom-built theme developed from scratch, providing a tailored design and functionality. This portfolio is intended for potential employers and clients to explore past work and get in touch. This theme depends on the fc-theme which is also custom-built by myself.

The website also utilizes several WordPress plugins to enhance functionality and manage content, such as **Polylang** for multilingual support and **ACF** for advanced custom fields.
